this is my prototype journal system webdev project uwu

# djournal

This project is an open source scholarly journal management and presentation system written in python. This uses the django > mysql > vue stack to keep it simple and in as little boilerplate as possible.

## Submissions App

The submissions app handles submitting to the journal, writing the file to the server filesystem, and then creating a new record in the ```submissions``` table in the mysql database.
